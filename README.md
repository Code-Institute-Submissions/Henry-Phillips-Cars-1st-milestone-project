  - Visually pleasing and easy to navigate.
  - Gives history and information on the business, owner, products, and services which do not give sensory overload.
  - Has easy to follow steps.
  - Gives new customers the confidence to book an appointment quickly and easily understanding the process that they will undertake when visiting the business and owner.

##### Colours and typography:

- Colours:
  After sitting down with the business owner and looking at a number of current websites with competitors,
  including main dealer car dealership websites we found that they were of neutral colours with a slight colour pop within the site.
  Usually to give more enthasis on quality and prestige. Under the advice of the business ownere the colours agreed were greys and greens to use as the colour pop within the site and dark grey and white for the text.

- Typography:
  "Roboto" font with the fallback of sans-serif for all headings and body content throughout the website.
  This was chosen for the clear professional style to make the content easily readable and universal throughout the site.

  "Noto Sans JP" with fallback of sans-serif was chosen as an additional typography for future developement and a change of style should we want to refresh the content on future versions
