### HTML

- [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) Was used to validate all HTML files within Henry Phillips Cars Web Application

- Received error messages for iframes not being permitted. Removed iframes and changed to object which I researched with Stackoverflow which corrected the error.

- Warning for sections which did not have Headings so I corrected the code and added headings where needed.
